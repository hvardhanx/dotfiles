It owrks nice, the created file has my edit user and the web server group. if I do the same for another server (VM/Debian) it somehow just doesn't work. I keeps using my user with whom I connect for both. any idea why's that?

2017-08-02 19:33:45	CatKiller	Any idea how to fix that?
2017-08-02 19:34:44	CatKiller	nevermind just came across good documentation answering just that

2017-08-02 20:34:19	mpan	One of the latest updates has cause my system to suddenly react to suspend key by suspending my syestem. After some reasearch I found that “/etc/systemd/logind.conf” has an option `HandleHibernateKey` which, according to man will ignore the key if set to `ignore`. So I have set it to that value. Is my thinking going the right way?

2017-08-14 01:21:11	grawity	makepkg says it's missing because you don't *have* it installd
2017-08-14 01:21:13	Dan39	mkoskar: they are different files i think
