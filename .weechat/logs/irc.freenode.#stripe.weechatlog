2017-08-02 18:37:54	@ywain	Hey gabrielsch, the subscription would be handled according to your account settings: https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/recurring. In addition, you could also use webhooks e.g. to reach out to the customer and ask them to update their card details. An `invoice.payment_failed` event will be sent for each failed payment attempt

2017-08-02 19:13:29	Dev0n	so, I'm a bit confused as to what's happening here: https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node/blob/ee3e1077295d69ab19f19e032f4fe93c0595d511/lib/Webhooks.js#L53
2017-08-02 19:14:16	Dev0n	the "expectedSignature" var is a hash computed using "_computeSignature", but then, the utils.secureCompare function attempts to do a buffer comparison: https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node/blob/ee3e1077295d69ab19f19e032f4fe93c0595d511/lib/utils.js#L134
2017-08-02 19:14:17	Dev0n	why?
2017-08-02 19:15:14	Dev0n	you can work though and see why this is failing because it then attempts to do Buffer.from on the hash string, which will of course fail.

2017-08-02 19:28:12	bhorbal	Do I do this through the source object, and how do I get the name to show up in the dashboard?
2017-08-02 19:28:13	@ywain	Dev0n: it's a protection against timing attacks. the string needs to be converted to a buffer to be safely compared. How to create the buffer from the string depends on the Node.js version, cf. https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buffer_from_buffer_alloc_and_buffer_allocunsafe
2017-08-02 19:28:36	JimR	I am trying to write a C# webhook receiver, but i cannor seem to get to the controller
2017-08-02 19:28:41	@ywain	awdng: which webhook exactly?
2017-08-02 19:29:13	@ywain	bhorbal: you probably want to collect it as part of the card information and include it in the token. This is done in your frontend code, using Checkout or Elements
2017-08-02 19:29:23	JimR	I am sending account.external_account.create
2017-08-02 19:29:40	awdng	@ywain source.chargeable after a 3d secure challenge
2017-08-02 19:30:17	JimR	is there a working simple c# webhook listner I can loook ayt?
2017-08-02 19:30:17	conviche	Am I correct in thinking that when I call Stripe.createSource with type 'sepa_debit' that the IBAN that is passed to the Sources endpoint, while TLS encrypted, is not as secure as payment details for credit cards which use Checkout.js or Elements that leverage iframes?

2017-08-02 19:30:52	@ywain	awdng: okay. You'll get a first `source.chargeable` event when creating the card source (since card sources are immediately chargeable) and a second event for the 3DS source after the customer completes the challenge. You can check the source's `type` to see if it's "card" or "three_d_secure"
2017-08-02 19:31:02	Dev0n	ywain, on node 4.2, Buffer.from exists and it'll fail because it's trying to do Buffer.from(<hash_string>)

2017-08-02 19:32:36	@ywain	bhorbal: the email is not part of the card information so it's not included in the token (which represents the card). you'd need to send it separately to your backend. are you using the token directly to create a charge, or are you creating a customer object first?
2017-08-02 19:32:43	@ywain	Dev0n: thanks!
2017-08-02 19:32:47	awdng	@ywain ah that makes sense, thanks! In this case the customers card is 3d secure "optional" but the challege of the bank just redirects without asking anything and we don't seem to be receiving the webhook..is that a bank issue ?

2017-08-02 19:33:41	@ywain	awdng: so in some cases, banks will immediately redirect back to your site without challenging the customer. But the source should still become chargeable and you'll still benefit from the 3DS liability shift. Is that different from what you're observing?
2017-08-02 19:33:48	bhorbal	ywain: I'm using the token directly. So I'm guessing (if using PHP) that I grab the email through a $_POST['email-whatever'] and pass that through to the receipt_email? Or is there another parameter I should be passing it to?
2017-08-02 19:34:26	MikeMike15	morning all!  was wondering how to retrieve the details of a payout destination?  From Stripe::Payout, destination: "ba_xxxxx"
2017-08-02 19:34:28	@ywain	bhorbal: that depends. Do you want to send an email receipt to the customer? or do you just want to store the email address for your own records?
2017-08-02 19:34:44	bhorbal	ywain: I want to do both.
2017-08-02 19:35:01	@ywain	Hi MikeMike15, is that for your own account, or are you a Connect platform managing payouts for connected accounts?
2017-08-02 19:35:11	MikeMike15	both actually

2017-08-02 19:35:46	awdng	@ywain i see. It worked for other customers like this, but for one case we did not receive the webhook. I see on the stripe interface that the source Status is "failed", so i guess the behaviour is expected right ?
2017-08-02 19:36:08	@ywain	bhorbal: okay, so `receipt_email` is the correct parameter for sending an email receipt. You'll be able to retrieve it via the API as well. If you want, you can also include the email in the charge's `description`, e.g. you'd set the description to be "Payment for customer@example.com"
2017-08-02 19:37:02	@ywain	MikeMike15: so for your own account, you cannot retrieve the details via the API. You can only see and update your payout information via the dashboard (https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/payouts). For connected accounts, you can retrieve details with https://stripe.com/docs/api#account_retrieve_bank_account
2017-08-02 19:37:23	MikeMike15	ah, gotcha.  Makes sense.
2017-08-02 19:37:25	conviche	I'm not saying it isn't secure enough just trying to understand how it works: cards inside iframes, other data such as ibans not inside iframes just TLS encrypted

2017-08-02 19:44:49	@ywain	bhorbal: no, not necessarily. if you set the email address in the `receipt_email` address, you'll be able to retrieve it later when retrieving the charge. You could also set the email address as a metadata key on the charge object (https://stripe.com/docs/charges#storing-information-in-metadata) and/or in the description as I said earlier

2017-08-02 19:51:40	conviche	how can I style the form generated when I use stripe.createSource for non-card payment information (such as IBAN for SEPA Direct Debit)?
2017-08-02 19:52:00	@koopajah	gabrielsch : well you should be able to have a stable QA url I assume
2017-08-02 19:52:11	@koopajah	conviche : it's your own form so you style it any way you want

2017-08-02 19:55:50	gabrielsch	I was reading this section: https://stripe.com/docs/subscriptions/webhooks#tracking and I noticed that you mention adding one or two days of "lee way", would like to double check if you guys what is this lee way, is it that recurring settings that we specify what are the payment retries delays?
2017-08-02 19:56:56	@koopajah	gabrielsch : it's more that you don't want to "block" the customer's access to your service the exact second the period ends. If you do, then every month they lose access until their invoice is paid and your code processes the event. It's better to have some "buffer" or "lee way" so that you have enough time to process the event (and recover from delays)

2017-08-02 20:10:46	larrik	so you can't update the metadata of a subscription with "cancel at period end" without reactivating it??
2017-08-02 20:12:46	@koopajah	larrik : you can, if you also pass `at_period_end: true` I think

2017-08-02 20:19:38	supercorn	i'm looking to implement a webhook in rails. I've created the event with Stripe::Webhook.construct_event. Should I just immediately render 200 and then process the event in action; or should I try to further validate the event against my own database objects before I render 200?
2017-08-02 20:20:19	supercorn	this app does not yet have background or delayed jobs and I'm avoiding them if I can for the time being

2017-08-02 20:20:59	@koopajah	I would recommend returning a 2xx now and then process the event and log errors if any
2017-08-02 20:22:24	supercorn	the 200 is simply acknowledging to stripe we got the error ok

2017-08-02 20:49:08	Guest64227	Hello, i'm trying to create a source with stripe js but the lib is calling the v1 of the api instead of v3. Any ideas why? my account is configured to use the latest version. I'm running on test mode.
2017-08-02 20:50:26	@koopajah	Guest64227 : that's 100% expected if I understand correctly. Our API only has one version all urls will have /v1/ when you make requests
