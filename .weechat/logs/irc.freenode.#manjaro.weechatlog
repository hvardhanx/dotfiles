2017-08-02 20:28:53	NestorJ	If it's 32 or 64 bits...
2017-08-02 20:29:02	Jolt2bolt	NestorJ, Manjaro is like some kind of rolling release so you're always up to dete
2017-08-02 20:29:04	Jolt2bolt	XDD
2017-08-02 20:29:07	Jolt2bolt	ahhh
2017-08-02 20:29:24	no_references	lsb_release -rd should show the version number
2017-08-02 20:29:36	Jolt2bolt	just do uname -a
2017-08-02 20:29:58	Jolt2bolt	or use the sysinfo command in hexchat
2017-08-02 20:29:59	Jolt2bolt	XDD
2017-08-02 20:30:00	no_references	that will show the kernel version
2017-08-02 20:30:07	NestorJ	That's the command I have to write in Terminal?
2017-08-02 20:30:10	Jolt2bolt	in the the windows menu
2017-08-02 20:30:13	no_references	lsb_release -rd
2017-08-02 20:30:14	Jolt2bolt	aha
2017-08-02 20:30:16	no_references	just write that
2017-08-02 20:30:22	NestorJ	Ok. Thanks!
2017-08-02 20:30:25	BugzBunny	The version in ArchLinux
2017-08-02 20:30:30	BugzBunny	Linux!
2017-08-02 20:30:32	BugzBunny	That's it
2017-08-02 20:30:40	BugzBunny	There is no fucking version
2017-08-02 20:30:51	morsus	Also I got some questions about environment of Manjaro. When I open eg. 3 tabs in FireFox and I minimise it, when I try to get it back up (by clicking the task on the taskbar at the bottom) it shows me those 3 tabs instead of popping the FireFox back in full screen, Is there a way to change this?
2017-08-02 20:30:55	MiLeon	lsb_release -i -d -c
2017-08-02 20:31:00	Jolt2bolt	NestorJ, better use uname -a that give you the version you have installed
2017-08-02 20:31:01	Jolt2bolt	XDD
2017-08-02 20:31:04	+peetaur2	no, there's linux and linux-lts :P

2017-08-02 20:31:33	BugzBunny	Codename:	n/a
2017-08-02 20:31:34	no_references	Well version is vague, could be the kernel version or manjaro version, which is 17.02
2017-08-02 20:31:48	morsus	let me take a screenshot
2017-08-02 20:31:53	MiLeon	okay
2017-08-02 20:32:07	Jolt2bolt	I mean if it is 32 bit it should say x86 and if it's 64 bits it should say x86_64
2017-08-02 20:32:07	Jolt2bolt	XDD
2017-08-02 20:32:36	no_references	that's a different meaning of version
2017-08-02 20:32:39	morsus	MiLeon,  my bad I actually had 3 FireFox open :/
2017-08-02 20:32:40	no_references	xD
2017-08-02 20:32:50	MiLeon	okay :-)
2017-08-02 20:33:24	banavara	I have asked this before when there was not many people, so asking again
2017-08-02 20:33:28	banavara	hi on Manjaro XFCE, when screen is locked, it locks twice
2017-08-02 20:33:28	banavara	ie, once unlocked, it again gets locked immediately and have to unlock it again
2017-08-02 20:33:28	banavara	how to get this resolved
2017-08-02 20:33:38	Jolt2bolt	no_references, well he was asking what version of manjaro he has installed because you can install 32 bits intallation in 64 bits processor!:P
2017-08-02 20:34:12	NestorJ	It's appear this when I use uname -a: "Linux nestorJG-pc 4.9.39-1-MANJARO #1 SMP PREEMPT Fri Jul 21 10:37:40 UTC 2017 i686 GNU/Linux"
2017-08-02 20:34:21	Jolt2bolt	banavara, change you locker to i3locker because the XFCE locker is bugged since... I know...
2017-08-02 20:34:22	Jolt2bolt	XDD
2017-08-02 20:34:29	no_references	but Manjaro version could also be 17.02 which is the version of manjaro, but not bit type
2017-08-02 20:34:37	no_references	nvm lol
2017-08-02 20:34:39	Jolt2bolt	NestorJ, that mean you're using a 32 bits version

2017-08-02 20:35:08	Jolt2bolt	i nforgot it was i686 not x86!XDD
2017-08-02 20:35:09	NestorJ	And How do I can change to 64 bits version?
2017-08-02 20:35:41	NestorJ	Do I have to reinstall Majaro's Linux again?
2017-08-02 20:35:42	Jolt2bolt	downloading and installing the 64 bit version is the easiest path
2017-08-02 20:35:56	+peetaur2	NestorJ: other than reinstall? maybe install a 64 bit kernel and boot into that, then replace all the userland stuff while running the 64 bit kernel
2017-08-02 20:36:17	Jolt2bolt	well you can change to 64 bits without intalling but it's a long and time consuming path
2017-08-02 20:36:19	+peetaur2	for fun, but not for time saving, since surely it'll fail and eat all your time until it works
2017-08-02 20:36:19	NestorJ	Ok. I execute Steam and it says to me that only plays on Linux 64 bits
2017-08-02 20:37:47	Jolt2bolt	peetaur2, well he might need to change to manjaro x86_64 repos, do a pacman -Syyu and activate multilib too!:P
2017-08-02 20:38:02	Jolt2bolt	peetaur2, I never tried but sound like fun!:D
2017-08-02 20:38:26	banavara	Jolt2bolt, I am being more and more inclined to change hte locker. peetaur2 too suggested to chnange

2017-08-02 20:39:31	banavara	I iwll remove light locker and try i3lock OR slock
2017-08-02 20:39:36	Jolt2bolt	banavara, then change it for that. I suggested that because I'm a minimalist in heart. I really like cute but funtional software that is low resource usage!:P
2017-08-02 20:39:50	morsus	There is all windows, RHEL, ubunty and Linux 32/64
2017-08-02 20:39:54	Jolt2bolt	banavara, I really like i3locker!:P
2017-08-02 20:39:56	morsus	if i click linux
